### Course Goals

This class aims to introduce practitioners to problems from the history of science, art, technology, and infrastructure.  Students will gain experience
with some popular texts from the discipline through weekly readings.  We will examine a variety of texts that explore the problem of representation
objectivity, evidence, and truth.  By the end of the course, students should make use of this literature to produce an original work.

The material nature of this work is open, and can be a traditional written assignment or an artistic work of any media.  We will propse
a direction for our work during Week 4 and continue to devote classtime to developing skills with a multitude of technologies in order 
to create.

### Structure

We aim to have this class as a workshop to push our understanding of technology and media in our own work.  To begin, we will discuss the weeks readings and how they might contribute to our own work explicitly.  Next, we will dedicate a portion of time to familiarizing ourselves with some tools of textual analysis on the computer.  Finally, the end of class will be time for us to give status reports and receive feedback on our projects development.

### Assignments

*Readings*:
Each week you will be asked to summarize and deepen a specific element of our readings.  You should prepare a single page of notes that highlight the important elements of your topic.  

*Final Work and Presentation*:
Each student will be asked to propose, present for critique and discussion, and submit a final product of their design.  We will propose the project in Week 4, present our work to the class in week 12, and submit our work on the final day of classes for the semester.  The aim of these works will be targeted submission in a creative event in the discipline of your choice, including traditional academic conferences and or journals.

### Course Policiies

We will make heavy use of technology in this class.  By the end of the class we expect that every student understands how to use a text editor to produce paper and web based documents.  Additionally, we will use computers to analyze textual, visual, and audio documents.  Students will be able to propose research projects that deepen an understanding through such analyses.
