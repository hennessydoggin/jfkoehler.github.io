# UA 101: Math Patterns in Nature

![](jfkoehler.github.io/math_patterns_in_nature/courant_header.png)


**Instructor:** Dr. Jacob Frias Koehler

**email:** jfk11@nyu.edu

**Office Hours:** Thursday 3 - 5 PM

### Objectives: 

In this course we focus on the distillation of mathematics from observations in nature. Specifically, we wish to observe a variety of natural scenarios and produce simple mathematical models based
on commonalities between the observations. The goal is to realize that mathematics (in a sense) is the
study of “how are things the same” and using mathematics to describe such underlying patterns gives
us a very useful tool in the investigation of the natural world. Topics include:

* Number and Number systems, Measurement and Scale, Units
* Arithmetic and Geometric Growth and Savings/Debt models
* Visions of Probability and their use in Expected Value
* Statistical Models
* Geometries and Triangles

### Class Meetings:

We will meet Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30 to 1:45 in 12WV G08.  Recitation sessions are scheduled for Friday 12:30 - 1:45 PM with Yuan Ni in 7E12 LL23 and from 2:00 - 3:15 PM with
Matthew Grote in 25W4 C-13.  The recitations are intended as an additional resource for students and attendance is mandatory.  Quizzes
will be given near weekly in the recitation sessions and will be an important component of students grades.

### Prerequisites: 

We assume you have had at least two years worth of high school mathematics.  Performing basic arithmetical operations solving basic equations
are assumed.

### Textbook:

*Quantitative Reasoning: Understanding the Mathematical Patterns in Nature*, 3rd edition (Fall
2006), by Frederick P. Greenleaf.  Please use the 3rd edition for problem set assignments.

### Computational Tools:

We encourage the use of computational tools in this class.  Depending on your available technology, you should be able to handle numbers
written in scientific notation and generate random numbers.  During quizzes and in-class examinations, you will not be able to use a
networked device such as a cell phone or a laptop, so it is important you have something like a handheld scientific calculator available.

### Class Participation and Workload:

Attend all lectures and recitation sessions.  You will have regular reading and homework assignments to complete.  Outside of class
you should expect to spend near six hours weekly devoted to work for this class.

### Grading:

- Homework 20%
- Quizzes 20%
- Midterm Exam 30%
- Final Exam 30%

### Homework:

Homework will be assigned weekly and primarily comprised of problems from the text.  Typically, the assignments will be given Thursdays and 
submitted in Recitation the following Friday.  Late homework will not be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made and you may not submit
homework anywhere but your registered recitation section.  You should aim to present your work in a neat, organized manner.  Sloppy and incomplete
papers may not receive credit.  Before the final grade computation, the two lowest homeworks will be dropped(except for zeros!).

### Quizzes: 

We will have 8 quizzes through the semester.  These will take roughly 20 - 30 minutes and take place in recitation sections.  The 
quizzes will be short and closely related to material from the lectures and homework problems.

### Exams:

We will have a midterm examination Thursday, March 8th and a final examination Thursday, May 3rd.  You will be able to use your calculuator
and a page of two sided notes. 

### University Policy Statements:

## What is this course about?

*Mathematical Patterns in Nature* was created as part of a three-course sequence devoted to mathematics and
topics in natural science, and its purpose is to show why mathematics is necessarily the language of science.
Thus, though this is a mathematics course, topics from science will make their appearance. The math topics
we cover are fairly elementary, but our use of them is not. In order to understand how scientists think, you
have to learn to think for yourself using the tools mathematics provides. This course aims to show how one
can take real world problems, translate them into mathematics, and solve them.
The use of mathematics in science crosses disciplinary boundaries. The sciences themselves cross each
others paths because they are, in the end, all related to each other. Frequently the same ideas will appear in
many of the sciences. Quantitative Reasoning explores the mathematical tools you need to understand why
mathematics became the language of science.
The different chapters of Quantitative Reasoning should be looked upon as case studies, chosen both for
their practicality (growth of money, for example), or their importance in understanding how mathematics is
used to model and understand nature.
In this course we will take up a few basic topics in mathematics and show how they can be used to
understand nature. Reasoning, based on a few simple ideas from mathematics, can carry you a long way in
understanding the natural world. Instead of having you memorize a lot of mathematical facts, this course
will show how mathematics can be applied in the real world.
The emphasis will not be on technical skills - Kafkaesque algebraic manipulations high school teachers
are so fond of. Nor will we stress memorizing facts; you will be allowed to bring extensive note of your own
choosing (double-sided 8 × 11 page) to most in-class exams. Our stance is that mathematics is, at its base,
the art of pattern recognition. That means:

* Taking a fuzzily stated question and seeing its essentials.
* Recognizing that many problems are similar when viewed the right way.
* Recognizing that many problems are really mathematical questions in disguise, and can be solved using a few simple mathematical tools.

Much of your work will be based on the class lecture notes that have been developed for use in this course.
Your instructor and TAs are willing to spend a lot of time helping you through any difficulties you may
have with the basic mathematics involved in this course. We understand that many fear mathematics and
are convinced that they cannot do it; we would like to prove them wrong.
