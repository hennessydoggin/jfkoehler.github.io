## Course Description

This class aims to introduce students to some uses of the function concept in mathematics.  Using both discrete and continuous examples, linear, polynomial, non-linear, and periodic functions in one and many variables are covered.  The use of these functions to model real world phenomena is the primary emphasis of our work.


 **Final Grade Calculation**

    - Participation/Attendance    15%

    - Homework                    40%

    - Exams                       20%

    - Final Paper                 25%


## Course Requirements/Assignments/Graded Activities

Each week you will be asked to submit one assignment.  You will have one week to complete the assignment.  This assignment will consist in a brief synthesis of our weekly readings as well as answers to our weekly problem set.  The problem sets will be posted weekly on Canvas and are to be submitted here as single pdf files.


**TEXTBOOKS**: The text is freely available through The New School library.  

    Gordon, Sheldon P., and Gordon, Florence S. Functions, Data and Models : An Applied Approach to College Algebra. Washington, US: Mathematical Association of America, 2010. 




We will have two in class examinations.  The first will take place during week 6 and cover Chapters 1 - 4 of the textbook.  Exam 2 will take place during week 12 and cover Chapters 5 - 8.  The exams will be based on problems from the homework, and will be completed in class.


Finally, you will complete a 7 - 10 page final paper that is a deeper exploration of a topic from class.  You will also prepare a brief 3 - 5 minute presentation that you will receive feedback on, revise, and present again to the group. 

### Learning Outcomes

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

    1. Describe the characteristics of linear and non-linear functions
    2. Model phenomena using linear and non-linear functions
    3. Use Matrices to solve mathematical problems
    4. Use regression to find lines of best fit
    5. Use technology to solve mathematical problems
    6. Connect mathematics to personal area of interest

### Resources 
The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:

    University Libraries: http://library.newschool.edu
    University Learning Center: http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center
    University Disabilities Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/
    
In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.


Student Ombuds: http://www.newschool.edu/intercultural-support/ombuds/
The Student Ombuds office provides students assistance in resolving conflicts, disputes or complaints on an informal basis. This office is independent, neutral, and confidential. 
University, College/School, and Program Policies

### Academic Honesty and Integrity


Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at http://www.newschool.edu/policies/

Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website: 
http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/avoiding-plagiarism.pdf

### Attendance
“Absences may justify some grade reduction and a total of four absences mandate a reduction of one letter grade for the course. More than four absences mandate a failing grade for the course, unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as the following: 
an extended illness requiring hospitalization or visit to a physician (with documentation); a family emergency, e.g. serious illness (with written explanation); observance of a religious holiday.

The attendance and lateness policies are enforced as of the first day of classes for all registered students. If registered during the first week of the add/drop period, the student is responsible for any missed assignments and coursework.

For significant lateness, the instructor may consider the tardiness as an absence for the day. Students failing a course due to attendance should consult with an academic advisor to discuss options.

### Course Policies
No late assignments will be accepted. Students will be given 2 opportunities for revisions of assignments. These must be submitted the following week with the new homework assignment. Only problems with some kind of effort and commentary are eligible for revision. I will offer extra credit with every homework assignment.

I will assume that every student has access to a laptop computer, and that you bring this with you to every class. You will need to be able to download and install programs on this computer. If you do not have access to a laptop, please let me know immediately and we will figure out getting you a machine.

All assignments will be posted on canvas. After the first week, you are to submit your files electronically through our **sagemathcloud** page.

### Student Course Ratings
During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys. Instructions are available online at http://www.newschool.edu/provost/course-evaluations-student-instructions.pdf.



### Outline

We will begin the class with an investigation of functions.  We aim to understand the key characteristics of linear, exponential, quadratic, and trigonometric functions.  Additionally, we aim to see how these functions can be used to model phenomena including simple and compound interest, population growth, and periodic motion.  Finally, we will fit functions to data using regression.

In the second section of the course, we will examine systems of functions.  This builds on our investigations of single functions.  Here, we introduce the matrix as a mathematical object of great use to both solving systems and manipulating objects that can be represented as systems of functions.

Finally, we will use our knowledge of models and data to investigate a problem of our own interest.  Our goal will be to develop a mathematical model of real world phenomena using high quality data.  We will use technology to access, analyze, and present our findings.
