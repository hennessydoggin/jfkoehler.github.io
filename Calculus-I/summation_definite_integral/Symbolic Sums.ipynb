    "## More Summations and Al-Haytham's Paraboloid\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the symbolic computing power of the **sympy** package to evaluate summations and the calculate the volume of a paraboloid following ibn Al-Haytham's method.  Again, we will see the power of pre-Rennaisance algorithmic thinking and its connection to modern day computation in iPython.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First we will examine some basic functionality of the **sympy** package.  Next, we will look at how to use **sympy** to evaluate summations that we've examined in class as well as some more complicated summations.  Finally, we will see how to use these to evaluate the volume of a Paraboloid following Al-Haytham's example."
