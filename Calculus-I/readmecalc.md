## Outline
Eventually I aim to finalize notebooks dealing with the following topics:

* Summation and the Definite Integral
    * Motivating the problem of quadrature with integer summations.
    * Using Approximating Rectangles, Trapezoids, and Parabolas to find areas and solve accumulation problems
    * Use the definite integral to solve Area and Volume problems
    * Use the definite integral to discuss wealth inequality through the Gini Index
    * Use ideas of summations to solve problems involving discrete center of mass problems, relate these to descriptive statistics
    * Use the definite integral to solve continuous center of mass and traditional force problems in Physics--introduce Newton's Second Law

* Derivatives and Applications

    * Finite differences and Average Velocity
    * Instantaneous Rates of Change
    * Using the Derivative to find maximum and minimum values
    * Applying maximization ideas to Game Theory through Nash Arbitration Scheme
    * Applying minimization ideas to Least Squares Regression
    * Using derivatives to understand Elasticity of Demand and Log transforms
    * Using derivatives to solve equations--Newton's method and a taste of Chaos

* Differential Equations and Discrete Systems

    * Slope Fields and Visualizations
    * Euler's Method
    * Heating and Cooling Models
    * Population models--Exponential and Logistic--Chaos again.
    * Predator Prey Models --Lotka Volterra and its improvements
    * Discrete Dynamical Systems --Cobweb Diagrams and the language of fixed points, orbits, phase diagram, attracting and repelling fixed points; relations to IVT and MVT

* Higher Dimensions

    * Plotting in 3-D -- Cartesian and Parametric
    * Partial Derivatives and max/min in 3D
    * Constrained Optimization and Lagrange
    * Partial Differential Equations -- The Heat Equation
    * Partial Differential Equations -- The Wave Equation
