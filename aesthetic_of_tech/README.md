### Course Goals

This class aims to introduce practitioners to problems from the history of science, art, technology, and infrastructure.  Students will gain experience
with some popular texts from the discipline through weekly readings.  We will examine a variety of texts that explore the problem of representation
objectivity, evidence, and truth.  By the end of the course, students should make use of this literature to produce an original work.

The material nature of this work is open, and can be a traditional written assignment or an artistic work of any media.  We will propse
a direction for our work during Week 4 and continue to devote classtime to developing skills with a multitude of technologies in order 
to create.  Provisionally, these include wood, metal, photography, video, raspberry pi, mathematics, and a variety of uses of computing technology.
